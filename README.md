# Candidate-Test
Hello Sir,

This is the document that i am going to submit as my candidate-test for creating small web application.
As i asked you about the database, I am not able to access it. So i just take static data in controller file and try to solve problem.

I also mentioned the code that we can do to create,update and remove rug inventory with specific comment.


Appname : RugInfoApp --> server.js
                         Public --> Controllers --> controller.js
                                    index.html
